- delete meal popover doesn't work, clicking outside also closes 
the view meal dialog. What about a novel means of deleting? It needs
an 'are you sure' element, which usually means clicking twice.
I could:
- slider, drag to right to delete
- button press counter; press 2/3 times to really delete it

- can I put 'clickOutsideClose' on the meal/tag create dialogs
